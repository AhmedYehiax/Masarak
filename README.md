Project Overview

Objective: To develop a mobile application that helps users plan their metro journeys by identifying the nearest station and providing a detailed route to their desired destination. The app will calculate the exact route, number of stops, transfer stations, estimated travel time, and cost without using map features.

Scope of Work: The project involves creating a metro route planner app where users input their current station and destination station. The app will then process the metro lines to provide a detailed journey plan, including station transfers and expected travel time and cost.

Expected Outcomes:

A functional mobile application built using Flutter and Dart.
An easy-to-use interface that displays the metro route, number of stops, station transfers, estimated travel time, and cost without relying on maps.
Problem Statement: Metro users often find it difficult to determine the best route, time, and cost for their journey, especially when multiple transfers between lines are required. Current navigation apps often rely on map integration, which may not always be necessary or convenient for quick metro journeys.

Proposed Solution

Technologies Used:

Flutter for the mobile front-end by Dart
SQLite or JSON for storing metro station data and lines
Google Places API to fetch metro station information
System Architecture:

The system will use user input to determine the current and destination stations.
A database of metro stations and routes will be queried to find the optimal path.
The app will compute the journey details (number of stops, station transfers, total time, and cost) and display them to the user.
Resources Needed

Hardware/Software:

A development environment with Flutter and Dart installed.
Devices for testing (Android/iOS phones).
